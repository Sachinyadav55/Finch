@article{Sampson:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Mycobacteriophages BPs, Angel and Halo are closely related viruses isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis, and possess the smallest known mycobacteriophage genomes, 41,901 bp, 42,289 bp and 41,441 bp, respectively. Comparative genome analysis reveals a novel class of ultra-small mobile genetic elements; BPs and Halo each contain an insertion of the proposed mobile elements MPME1 and MPME2, respectively, at different locations, while Angel contains neither. The close similarity of the genomes provides a comparison of the pre- and post-integration sequences, revealing an unusual 6 bp insertion at one end of the element and no target duplication. Nine additional copies of these mobile elements are identified in a variety of different contexts in other mycobacteriophage genomes. In addition, BPs, Angel and Halo have an unusual lysogeny module in which the repressor and integrase genes are closely linked. The attP site is located within the repressor-coding region, such that prophage formation results in expression of a C-terminally truncated, but active, form of the repressor.},

	Abstract = {We investigate off-line dictionary oriented approaches to DNA sequence compression, based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). The preponderance of short repeating patterns is an important phenomenon in biological sequences. Here, we propose off-line methods to compress DNA sequences that exploit the different repetition structures inherent in such sequences. Repetition analysis is performed based on the relationship between the BWT and important pattern matching data structures, such as the suffix tree and suffix array. We discuss how the proposed approach can be incorporated in the BWT compression pipeline.},

@article{Grabherr:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA has enabled deep and efficient probing of transcriptomes. Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

@article{Chor:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The empirical frequencies of DNA k-mers in whole genome sequences provide an interesting perspective on genomic complexity, and the availability of large segments of genomic sequence from many organisms means that analysis of k-mers with non-trivial lengths is now possible.
RESULTS: We have studied the k-mer spectra of more than 100 species from Archea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota, particularly looking at the modalities of the distributions. As expected, most species have a unimodal k-mer spectrum. However, a few species, including all mammals, have multimodal spectra. These species coincide with the tetrapods. Genomic sequences are clearly very complex, and cannot be fully explained by any simple probabilistic model. Yet we sought such an explanation for the observed modalities, and discovered that low-order Markov models capture this property (and some others) fairly well.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal spectra are characterized by specific ranges of values of C+G content and of CpG dinucleotide suppression, a range that encompasses all tetrapods analyzed. Other genomes, like that of the protozoa Entamoeba histolytica, which also exhibits CpG suppression, do not have multimodal k-mer spectra. Groupings of functional elements of the human genome also have a clear modality, and exhibit either a unimodal or multimodal behaviour, depending on the two above mentioned values.},

@article{Morgenstern:1996aa,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a new way to think about, and to construct, pairwise as well as multiple alignments of DNA and protein sequences is proposed. Rather than forcing alignments to either align single residues or to introduce gaps by defining an alignment as a path running right from the source up to the sink in the associated dot-matrix diagram, we propose to consider alignments as consistent equivalence relations defined on the set of all positions occurring in all sequences under consideration. We also propose constructing alignments from whole segments exhibiting highly significant overall similarity rather than by aligning individual residues. Consequently, we present an alignment algorithm that (i) is based on segment-to-segment comparison instead of the commonly used residue-to-residue comparison and which (ii) avoids the well-known difficulties concerning the choice of appropriate gap penalties: gaps are not treated explicity, but remain as those parts of the sequences that do not belong to any of the aligned segments. Finally, we discuss the application of our algorithm to two test examples and compare it with commonly used alignment methods. As a first example, we aligned a set of 11 DNA sequences coding for functional helix-loop-helix proteins. Though the sequences show only low overall similarity, our program correctly aligned all of the 11 functional sites, which was a unique result among the methods tested. As a by-product, the reading frames of the sequences were identified. Next, we aligned a set of ribonuclease H proteins and compared our results with alignments produced by other programs as reported by McClure et al. [McClure, M. A., Vasi, T. K. & Fitch, W. M. (1994) Mol. Biol. Evol. 11, 571-592]. Our program was one of the best scoring programs. However, in contrast to other methods, our protein alignments are independent of user-defined parameters.},

@article{Vingron:1994aa,
	Abstract = {Alignment algorithms to compare DNA or amino acid sequences are widely used tools in molecular biology. The algorithms depend on the setting of various parameters, most notably gap penalties. The effect that such parameters have on the resulting alignments is still poorly understood. This paper begins by reviewing two recent advances in algorithms and probability that enable us to take a new approach to this question. The first tool we introduce is a newly developed method to delineate efficiently all optimal alignments arising under all choices of parameters. The second tool comprises insights into the statistical behavior of optimal alignment scores. From this we gain a better understanding of the dependence of alignments on parameters in general. We propose novel criteria to detect biologically good alignments and highlight some specific features about the interaction between similarity matrices and gap penalties. To illustrate our analysis we present a detailed study of the comparison of two immunoglobulin sequences.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

@article{Salichos:2013aa,
	Abstract = {To tackle incongruence, the topological conflict between different gene trees, phylogenomic studies couple concatenation with practices such as rogue taxon removal or the use of slowly evolving genes. Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070 orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing ancient divergences.},

	Abstract = {Virus-like particles with five different morphotypes were observed in an enriched environmental sample from a hot, acidic spring (87 to 93 degrees C, pH 1.5) in Pozzuoli, Italy. The morphotypes included rigid rods, flexible filaments, and novel, exceptional forms. Particles of each type were isolated, and they were shown to represent viable virions of five novel viruses which infect members of the hyperthermophilic archaeal genus Acidianus. One of these, named the Acidianus bottle-shaped virus, ABV, exhibits a previously unreported morphotype. The bottle-shaped virion carries an envelope which encases a funnel-shaped core. The pointed end of the virion is likely to be involved in adsorption and channeling of viral DNA into host cells. The broad end exhibits 20 (+/- 2) thin filaments which appear to be inserted into a disk, or ring, and are interconnected at their bases. These filaments are apparently not involved in adsorption. ABV virions contain six proteins in the size range 15 to 80 kDa and a 23.9-kb linear, double-stranded DNA genome. Virus replication does not cause lysis of host cells. On the basis of its unique morphotype and structure, we propose to assign ABV to a new viral family, the Ampullaviridae.},

@article{Xiang:2005aa,
	Abstract = {A virus infecting the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus tengchongensis has been isolated from a field sample from Tengchong, China, and characterized. The virus, denoted STSV1 (Sulfolobus tengchongensis spindle-shaped virus 1), has the morphology of a spindle (230 by 107 nm) with a tail of variable length (68 nm on average) at one end and is the largest of the known spindle-shaped viruses. After infecting its host, the virus multiplied rapidly to high titers (>10(10) PFU/ml). Replication of the virus retarded host growth but did not cause lysis of the host cells. STSV1 did not integrate into the host chromosome and existed in a carrier state. The STSV1 DNA was modified in an unusual fashion, presumably by virally encoded modification systems. STSV1 harbors a double-stranded DNA genome of 75,294 bp, which shares no significant sequence similarity to those of fuselloviruses. The viral genome contains a total of 74 open reading frames (ORFs), among which 14 have a putative function. Five ORFs encode viral structural proteins, including a putative coat protein of high abundance. The products of the other nine ORFs are probably involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and DNA modification. The viral genome divides into two nearly equal halves of opposite gene orientation. This observation as well as a GC-skew analysis point to the presence of a putative viral origin of replication in the 1.4-kb intergenic region between ORF1 and ORF74. Both morphological and genomic features identify STSV1 as a novel virus infecting the genus Sulfolobus.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Converting nucleotide sequences into short overlapping fragments of uniform length, k-mers, is a common step in many bioinformatics applications. While existing software packages count k-mers, few are optimized for speed, offer an API (Application Programming Interface), a graphical interface, or contain features that make it extensible and maintainable. We designed KAnalyze to compete with the fastest k-mer counters, to produce reliable output, and to support future development efforts through well architected, documented, and testable code. Currently, KAnalyze can output k-mer counts in a sorted tab-delimited file or stream k-mers as they are read. KAnalyze can process large data sets with 2GB of memory. This project is implemented in Java 7, and the CLI (Command Line Interface) is designed to integrate into pipelines written in any language.
RESULTS: As a k-mer counter, KAnalyze outperforms Jellyfish (Mar{\c c}ais and Kingsford, 2011), DSK (Rizk et al., 2013), and a pipeline built on a Perl and Linux utilities. Through extensive unit and system testing, we have verified that KAnalyze produces the correct k-mer counts over multiple data sets and k-mer sizes.
AVAILABILITY: KAnalyze is available on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/kanalyze/ SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
